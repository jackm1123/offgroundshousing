                                        Yelp for Off Ground Housing
## We have created an app for off ground housing in UVA area. Here is the link to our application, “Yelp for Off Ground Housing”:
https://segfaulters3240.herokuapp.com/
## A “Staff Account” has been created for the Prof Sherriff to access the application. The username and password have been provided via the google form.
## In order to log in, users need UVA student credentials to pass through Netbadge. (Added security features to whitelist the authorized users to access the application) 
## Each housing option has been listed in under “listings”. Users can easily view, rate, and submit a review for each listing. However, only the application admin has the ability to create a listing or activate/deactivate an existing listing!
## If you have any questions or concerns, please reach us at segfaulter3240@gmail.com.
